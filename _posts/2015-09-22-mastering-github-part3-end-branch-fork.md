### DiffMerge

TortoiseGIT comes with a full Diff/Merge tool :)

### Branching

I forked the jekyll-bootstrap repo to improve it later, because it is still unfinished according to the author.

It's really useful to put up a simple github pages blog in seconds with jekyll and bootstrap theme.

### GitHub Pages

Last but not least we were asked to create a blog using GitHub Pages.
Here it is you just finished reading it. I hope to use this particular kind of web hosting a lot more now !

TortoiseGIT comes with a full Diff/Merge tool :)

### Branching

Work with a partner to fork their repository via GitHub. Now you can modify and work with your own copy of that repository. You can fork anything on GitHub, that is what the community is about!
Now since you are working with a partner you can organize to create a pull request so that your modifications on your forked repository go back to her main repository that you forked from.


### GitHub Pages

Last but not least we were asked to create a blog using GitHub Pages.
Here it is you just finished reading it. I hope to use this particular kind of web hosting a lot more now !
